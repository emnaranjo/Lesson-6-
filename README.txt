Hello Professor 

This is an old git I made months ago and it is necessary I use this because the wifi in my current living situation blocks file transfer via FTP and the creation of a new git repository. Editing an existing repository is still possible. I will try and figure a solution out for next week and get this uploaded to the FTP server as soon as possible.
